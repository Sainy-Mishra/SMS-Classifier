## Spam Email Message Classifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham). 
I have used major classification model such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra trees, XG Boost, Gradient Boost, Bagging and K-Means Neighbours. 

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The evaluation results provide insights into how well the model distinguishes between spam and ham emails.

Sample evaluation metrics:
